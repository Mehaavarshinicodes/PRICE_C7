## The Core Problem Solved
Traditional retail demand forecasting relies solely on historical sales, missing fast-moving social media trends and cultural micro-surges. This leads to stockouts of trending viral items and overstock of rapidly fading fads. 

The Solution: This application predicts upcoming demand surges by combining historical sales velocity with external cultural signals (trend sentiment scores and momentum), enabling boutique buyers to order inventory before a trend peaks.

## Target End Customer
- Primary: Retail Buyers and Inventory Planners at boutique clothing stores.
- Secondary: E-commerce merchandisers managing short product lifecycles.

## Technical and Data Requirements
1. Data: A mock CSV dataset containing columns for:
   - Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Item_Category (e.g., Streetwear Cargo Pants, Y2K Denim Jackets, Cottagecore Maxi Dresses)
   - Historical_Sales_Volume (daily units sold)
   - Social_Media_Trend_Score (0-100 normalized cultural momentum score)
2. Logic (forecaster.py):
   - load_trend_data(filepath)
   - forecast_demand(df, category, forecast_days, social_weight): Implements predictive time-series projection combining moving average velocity with social score acceleration and confidence bands.
3. UI / Dashboard (app.py):
   - Streamlit dashboard with category dropdown and forecast horizon slider.
   - Interactive Plotly line charts displaying historical sales vs projected 30-day demand with 95% confidence intervals.
   - Mood Board cards showcasing visual signals of the forecasted trend.

## Execution Strategy and Prompt Log

### Prompt 1: Synthetic Seasonal Data Generation
> "Write a Python script using pandas and numpy that generates a realistic CSV dataset with columns: Date, Item_Category, Historical_Sales_Volume, and Social_Media_Trend_Score. Simulate 180 days across 5 apparel categories with weekly seasonality and social media spikes."

### Prompt 2: Trend Forecasting Algorithm
> "Write a Python function forecast_demand that takes historical sales and a social media trend score. Fit a trend line on recent sales, calculate day-of-week multipliers, and amplify the 30-day projection based on social media momentum with upper and lower confidence intervals."

### Prompt 3: Streamlit and Plotly Dashboard
> "Create a Streamlit dashboard with a dark theme. Add a sidebar to select categories and forecast horizon. Display 4 metric cards (Social Trend Score, 30-day Projected Demand, Growth Shift, Peak Date). Plot historical sales and the 30-day forecast with a shaded confidence ribbon using Plotly graph_objects. Add a visual mood board gallery at the bottom."

```bash
# 1. Activate your virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Launch the Streamlit application
streamlit run app.py
```

## How to Run Automated Unit Tests

```bash
# Run pytest for Team 1
pytest tests/test_team01.py -v

# Run evaluator autograder
python ../../evaluator/autograder.py --team 1
```
